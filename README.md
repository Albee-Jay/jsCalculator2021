# jsCalculator2021
A JavaScript Calculator project created for FreeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries curriculum.

I do have one item that I couldn't satisfy (so far) and I need to work more on the styling but you can see it live right here: https://albee-jay.github.io/jsCalculator2021/.

I welcome and appreciate any and all feedback or help to make this project better.

Thank you, Albee-Jay
